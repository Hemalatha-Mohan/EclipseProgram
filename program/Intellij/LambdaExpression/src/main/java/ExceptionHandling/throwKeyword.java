    /*Throws Keyword
    Throws keyword is used when callee doesnâ€™t want to handle the exception rather
    it wants to extend this responsibility of handling the exception to the caller of the function.
Basically says what sort of exception the code can throw and relies on the caller to handle it.
It is used to handle checked Exceptions as the compiler will not allow code to compile until they are handled.

		   System.out.println(10/a);
